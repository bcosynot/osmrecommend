## Aim
The main aim or goal of this project is to create a recommendation system that suggests elements and/or places to edit. The recommendations will most probably be based on the user's edit history. I will be looking at various algorithms and what might work best for this purpose.

## Current status
The project is in a very nascent stage at this point of time. Right now, data acquisition has turned out to be an interesting challenge and is something I am working on.

Meanwhile, I have been working on getting the necessary underlying code ready. Some amount of that work is complete, but there is a lot of work still to be done. The code is quite dirty and is completely lacking in documentation. These aspects will be handled as the project matures.

## Trying it out
Well, at this point you could try it out if you have a database setup with the OSM's pgsnapshot (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs#pgsnapshot) schema.

Note that the schema I would finally like to use with this project has not been finalised yet.

Next, clone the project from github and use gradle to run it. More instructions to follow.
